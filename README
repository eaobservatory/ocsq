OMP/OCS QUEUE
=============

This is the UKIRT and JCMT observing queue for the new OMP/OCS system.
The following systems are included:

  ocsqueue

    This is the queue itself. It is currently a DRAMA task (technically
    Jit). 

  ocsqmon

    A small wrapper around the OCSQMonitor Tk widget. Provides a user
    interface to the queue.

  jac_inst

    This is a DRAMA task that emulates the "OBSERVE" interface of the
    actual JAC instrument task.

Running up the UKIRT queue
--------------------------

To run up the UKIRT queue:

  % ocsqueue -tel ukirt

With the -sim option, MSBs will not be accepted and the queue will
send entries to the JAC_INST_TEST drama task (started by running up
the jac_inst dummy task found in this directory).

To run up the queue monitor GUI:

  % ocsqmon -tel ukirt

This can be run on any machine. It will look for the queue on 
kiki. [need to fix]
